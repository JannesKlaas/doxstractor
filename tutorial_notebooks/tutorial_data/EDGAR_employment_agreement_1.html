lesser area, activity or time period which is deemed by the court to be reasonable and enforceable under applicable law. In this regard, the covenants shall be divisible as to activity, time and geographic area with each month deemed to be a
separate period of time and each state and country, or part thereof, deemed to be a separate geographic area. Employee further agrees that PPD may, at its option, seek to enforce the covenant as to any lesser area, activity or time period which PPD

Employee&#146;s termination, this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to enforcement of the restrictions contained herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event PPD terminates Employee&#146;s employment due to a reduction in
force or layoff in connection with the discontinuation or cessation of a business line, unit, function or department, PPD shall not enforce Section&nbsp;1.1 of the Agreement. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:8%"><FONT
